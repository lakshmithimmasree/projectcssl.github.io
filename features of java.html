            <h1>Features of Java Explained</h1>
        </center>
        <p>
            The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability.
            Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust 
            type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features.
            In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use.
            <br><br>
            Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and <br>
            adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike.
            <br><br>
            Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. There are many useful classes and functions in <br>
            Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h1>Advantages of using Java </h1>
        <p>The use of Java as a programming language has a number of benefits. Some of the main benefits are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java is a straightforward programming language since it is simple to learn and comprehend.</li>
            <li>Java uses implicit pointers, making it a secure programming language.</li>
            <li>Java code does not need to be constantly compiled in order to execute on a variety of systems.</li>
            <li>Java has strong memory management, making it a robust programming language.</li>
            <li>The above are some of the advantages of using Java and building applications making it the most popular programming language after Python. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Features of Java</h1>
        <p>A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Platform independence: Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without any changes on any platform that supports Java.</li>
            <li>Object-oriented language: Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular, reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</li>
            <li>Automatic memory management: Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers of the need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.</li>
            <li> Security: Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</li>
            <li>Rich API: The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of practical tools for creating applications. </li>
            <li>Multi-threading support: Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent applications that can handle running several threads at once.</li>
            <li>High performance: Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution while it is running. </li>
            <li>Scalability: Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand. </li>
            <li>Simplified syntax: Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for developers to write and read code.</li>
        </ul>
