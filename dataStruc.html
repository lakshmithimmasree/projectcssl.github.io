        <center><h1>What is Data Structure and Algorithm?</h1></center>
        <br>
        <p>
            You may already know that computers are used to store and modify massive amounts of data. Data structures are used to efficiently and conveniently arrange and store data.
            Organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used effectively is known as a data structure.In addition to defining the relationships between
            data pieces, it offers a means of representing and storing data. Common data structures include trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, arrays, and stacks. 
            <br> <br> 
            Now, an algorithm is a set of guidelines or procedures used to complete a task or solve a problem.To get a certain outcome, algorithms are used to alter data that is
            stored in data structures. Data in an array or linked list can be sorted using a sorting algorithm, for instance. 
            <br><br>
            Data structures and algorithms are closely associated in computer science because an algorithm’s effectiveness frequently depends on the selection of an effective data structure. 
            An algorithm can become more effective and quick with the right data format. For instance, a hash table is a popular data structure for quick data retrieval and searching. 
            <br><br>
            It is impossible to emphasize the significance of data structures and algorithms in computer science. Writing effective computer programs requires an understanding of these fundamental 
            ideas, which serve as the cornerstone of software development.For example, suppose you are creating software to look for a specific name in a large client database. Your program’s 
            effectiveness will be influenced by the algorithm and data format you choose. Your software could take a long time to finish the search if you pick a poor data structure or technique. 
            Yet, your program will run more quickly and efficiently if you select an effective data structure and algorithm. 
            <br><br>

            <center><h1>What are Data Structures and types?</h1></center>
            <p>
                Data structures are specific methods for setting up and keeping data in a computer so that it may be accessed, changed, and searched quickly. There are many different kinds of data structures,
                and each has benefits and drawbacks that vary depending on the objectives of the application.
            </p>
            <h1>1. Arrays</h1>
            <p>
                Arrays are a type of data structure that keep a group of identically categorised elements in close proximity to one another in memory. Despite having a fixed size, they can be ineffective for 
                dynamic data or big datasets since they require constant-time access to individual items via an index.
            </p>
            <h1>2. Linked Lists</h1>
            <p>
                Linked lists are a type of data structure that are made up of a series of nodes, each of which contains an element and a reference to the node after it in the list. They are distinguished by their 
                speedy insert and delete of elements, but because of their non-contiguous memory allocation, their traversal may be slower than arrays.
            </p>
            <h1>3. Stacks and Queues</h1>
            <p>Data structures used for handling a group of components include stacks and queues. The LIFO (last-in, first-out) ordering of stacks distinguishes them from queues, which are distinguished by the FIFO  
                (first-in, first-out) ordering.
            </p>
            <h1> 4. Trees</h1>
            <p>4. Trees
                Trees are a type of hierarchical data structure that is made up of nodes and edges. There is one node known as the root that has no parents, and each node can have one or more children. The ability 
                to efficiently explore and arrange data in a hierarchical fashion is a characteristic of trees.
            </p>
            <h1>5. Graphs:</h1>
            <p>
                A graph is a data structure made up of nodes (vertices) and the connections between them (edges). They are useful for modelling networks, social media connections, and a variety of other tasks  
                because they can depict intricate interconnections between data.
            </p>
            <h1>What are Algorithms and types?</h1>
            <p>
                Algorithms are a collection of instructions or rules that must be followed in order to complete a task or solve an issue. There are many different kinds of algorithms, and each has benefits and 
                drawbacks that vary depending on the particular issue being solved.
            </p>
            <h1>1. Sorting Algorithms</h1>
            <p>
                Sorting algorithms are employed to categorize and organize the elements of a list or an array. Several of the most popular sorting formulas include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bubble Sort</li>
                <li>Insertion Sort</li>
                <li>Selection Sort</li>
                <li>Quick Sort</li>
                <li>Merge Sort</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>2. Searching Algorithms </h1>
            <p>
                Searching Algorithms:  are employed to locate a particular element in a list or an array. The following are some of the most popular search algorithms:
                <br><br>
                To find the desired element or to get to the end of the list, a linear search iterates through the list element by element.
                
                Binary Search divides the list into two halves, compares the middle element with the target element, and then repeatedly searches the relevant half of the list. 

            </p>
            <h1>3. Recursive Algorithms</h1>
            <p>
                Recursive algorithms are those that call themselves in order to solve a problem. They can be applied to a wide range of issues, including search and sorting algorithms. 
            </p>
            <h1>4. Greedy Algorithms</h1>
            <p>
                Greedy Algorithms: In order to achieve a globally optimal solution, greedy algorithms choose the locally optimal option at each step. They are frequently employed for optimization issues. 
            </p>
            <h1>5. Dynamic Programming Algorithms.</h1>
            <p>
                Algorithms for Dynamic Programming: Dynamic programming algorithms divide a problem into smaller subproblems and solve each subproblem just once. They can be more effective than brute force
                techniques and are frequently employed for optimization challenges
            </p>
            <h1>Conclusion.</h1>
