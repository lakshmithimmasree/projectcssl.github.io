        <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
                <p>
                    A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies,
                    such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others. <br> <br>

                    Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project. 
                    <br><br>
                    In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage  
                    front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases 
                    like MySQL or MongoDB. <br> <br>

                    The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer. <br> <br>

                    The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. 
                    Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector. <br> <br>

                </p>

                        <li><b>Start-up culture: </b> As start-up cultures have developed, there is now a greater need for full-stack developers because they can do numerous responsibilities in a smaller team, which makes them perfect for start-up settings.</li> <br>
