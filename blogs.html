                <h1>Features of Java Explained</h1>
            </center
            <p>
                The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, and scalability.
                Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust
                type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features.
                In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use.
                <br> <br>
                Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and 
                adaptability, which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike.
                <br><br>
                Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. There are many useful classes and functions in 
                Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development process while adding even more capability.

            <center><h1>What is Data Structure and Algorithm?</h1></center>
            <p>
                You may already know that computers are used to store and modify massive amounts of data. Data structures are used to efficiently and conveniently arrange and store data.
                Organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used effectively is known as a data structure.In addition to defining the relationships between
                data pieces, it offers a means of representing and storing data. Common data structures include trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, arrays, and stacks. <br><br>

                Now, an algorithm is a set of guidelines or procedures used to complete a task or solve a problem.To get a certain outcome, algorithms are used to alter data that is
                stored in data structures. Data in an array or linked list can be sorted using a sorting algorithm, for instance. <br><br>

                Data structures and algorithms are closely associated in computer science because an algorithm’s effectiveness frequently depends on the selection of an effective data structure.
                An algorithm can become more effective and quick with the right data format. For instance, a hash table is a popular data structure for quick data retrieval and searching. <br><br>

            <center> <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1></center>
            <p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies,
                such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others. <br> <br>

                Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project. <br><br>
                
                In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage 
                front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.</p> <br><br>
